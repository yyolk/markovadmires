I love you. I always see you on the elevator.  You're so cute.  I want to kiss your soft lips. Too bad you're probably straight, and that you don't even know my name. I have no idea what your name is but i always see you around. You are tall, skinny and you skate and you always have a red beanie on and you have 2 tattoos on one of your arms i dont remember which one but i think you are so cute but you seem really intimidating and would probably never notice me. You are on another level of cool that i will never ever be at. I wish i at least knew your name to stalk you on social network sites I saw you in Neimz today in a black hoodie with an H made out of pot leaves on the back.   This butt  Is yours for the eating.  Sincerely, Some girl you should smoke up with some day you dressed up as florence welch for halloween.  i want your d. ♥ Dear SAIC Secret Admirers:  So, this place just be Craigslist's Missed Connections for all the SAIC folk, no? No wonder I can't get enough: I saw you wearing that thing that you probably don't even own and I think you looked at me and I felt a spark and I'm horny as fuck and I need you and your ass and I'm hungry.  -I may or may not have posted on Missed Connections before. L.Q.  Your butt is mostly all I think about.  Sincerely, a dude you only hung out with a few times. Marley, you hot canadian queen. dear girl in the neiman with the pretty pink hair   i hope your ass is as pretty and pink. to the really attractive boy that works in the sharp media center, you have beautiful soft green eyes. i wish/hope you are gay. i want to check you out overnight. Dear blondes of SAIC,  You are all super beautiful. It's like a blonde dreamworld. What is this shit. I have no imagination now. You guys are it. Da best.  -Used to not like blondes To my Chocolate Chip,  You look like you stepped straight out of the 1950's. The way you dress and your bright red lips, inspire me. The mole on your lip looks like a chocolate chip. I just wanna bite it. You said you were studying therapy, you can explore my brain anytime.   Your admirer. Baby Kitten Foof,  Oh my lovely fluffy pumpkin.  You're a beautiful man, you make me excited when I smell you.  Let's just play, okay? Let's just wrestle for a little while.  I want to touch your pale skin, snuggle within your smooshy chest hair.  I crave your touch.  I dream of those deep blue, blue eyes.  I want you forever and always.   Love,   Ico ♥ Patrick from Columbus woodshop,  You're seriously a cute dude. You're so awkward and to be so tall, you're like a marshmallow. I want to hug you and make you sing Fall Out Boy songs because you remind me of Patrick Stump before he was super skinny... while welding...yes.  Teach me how to properly work that table saw baby. yes. please do.  -That girl who digs your tats and hats. Really cute korean guy who hangs out with Myohan and Justin, I think you where one of snap crackle pop...  You're seriously adorable. I think you have really cute lips and you're always wearing headphones...what are you listening to?! Woulda asked in person...but yeah no... no.  -sincerely, totally not your type. Brian- All these people are talkin' about your swag, and I'm here to add that I love how incredibly down to earth you are. You landed maybe 4/6 olies you attempted outside Pret, and the bottom of your board is...Swag. I'm reminded why I think skater kids are attracted.  Not a secret crush or a booty call, just tellin' you I think you're rad and you should never lose your good spirit. Keep that, be true to it, and nobody can ever get you down.  -a platonic admirer E. C  Hey Girl, I just wanna say- keep up what ever you're doing. dat butt is gonna get eatin up. WOOO!!!!  -N Gretel I see you all over the place those gorgeous dreads and that pretty face been too spaced to chase you around but I'd hound you if I thought I had a chance to get in your pants weave me in a dread or chain me to your bed or if you'd rather not, let's just go out and dance  -secret admirer for years ♥ To the super cute Filipino girl from Cali  You rock my world. I heard that you snore. Damn that's really cute. I loved when your hair had the green tips, very edgy. I think you are the one for me   Love, too shy to say hi you were giving tours today in Neiman around noon and were talking to a group of babies about my core class.  your black beanie and cheek bones were cute but something about those freakishly large eyes just made me feel like I should post something.  You could be gay, taken, or uninterested but none the less - you are, as they say, &quot;really really ridiculously good looking&quot;.   on the off chance you needed a pick me up (you're hot)  xoxo.  freakishly large eyed girl You work in the sullivan wood shop but only one day a week. I saw you by the security desk at columbus before my night class and are the most beautiful man i've ever seen..who are you??  -the tall brunette Sunjin! Where'd you go girl?
