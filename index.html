I love you. I always see you on the elevator.  You're so cute.  I want to kiss your soft lips. Too bad you're probably straight, and that you don't even know my name. I have no idea what your name is but i always see you around. You are tall, skinny and you skate and you always have a red beanie on and you have 2 tattoos on one of your arms i dont remember which one but i think you are so cute but you seem really intimidating and would probably never notice me. You are on another level of cool that i will never ever be at. I wish i at least knew your name to stalk you on social network sites I saw you in Neimz today in a black hoodie with an H made out of pot leaves on the back.   This butt  Is yours for the eating.  Sincerely, Some girl you should smoke up with some day you dressed up as florence welch for halloween.  i want your d. ♥ Dear SAIC Secret Admirers:  So, this place just be Craigslist's Missed Connections for all the SAIC folk, no? No wonder I can't get enough: I saw you wearing that thing that you probably don't even own and I think you looked at me and I felt a spark and I'm horny as fuck and I need you and your ass and I'm hungry.  -I may or may not have posted on Missed Connections before. L.Q.  Your butt is mostly all I think about.  Sincerely, a dude you only hung out with a few times.

Dear blondes of SAIC,  You are all super beautiful. It's like a blonde dreamworld. What is this shit. I have no imagination now. You guys are it. Da best.  -Used to not like blondes To my Chocolate Chip,  You look like you stepped straight out of the 1950's. The way you dress and your bright red lips, inspire me. The mole on your lip looks like a chocolate chip. I just wanna bite it. You said you were studying therapy, you can explore my brain anytime.   Your admirer. Baby Kitten Foof,  Oh my lovely fluffy pumpkin.  You're a beautiful man, you make me excited when I smell you.  Let's just play, okay? Let's just wrestle for a little while.  I want to touch your pale skin, snuggle within your smooshy chest hair.  I crave your touch.  I dream of those deep blue, blue eyes.  I want you forever and always.   Love,   Ico ♥ Patrick from Columbus woodshop,  You're seriously a cute dude. You're so awkward and to be so tall, you're like a marshmallow.

I sure hope you don't, cause that would be weird. Your such a nice person. Lets hang out and talk about turtles sometime cause I know you like turtles.
