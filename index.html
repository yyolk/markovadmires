An hour later, i'm in love with all of you. You're so adorable! I wish i went to your school, boohoo. you talked to me once, though I could barely hear what you were saying. Since then, we haven't spoken.   You're a really handsome dude, and I have no idea what your name is. I can't tell if that was flirting, I'm clueless about this romance thing. Sometimes I'll look at you in hopes that you'll look my way so I can wave and smile. Or I'll just stare at your hair and beard. We'll probably never speak again, but it was nice to see your pretty smile.
