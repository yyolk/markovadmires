Semesters running out. Yours truly, shy guy To the girl in that black bomber jacket and high heels  I see you all the time in the basement of Columbus. You really know how to handle your tools, I'd like to find out what else you can handle ;). Those tight black pants and extra small shirts make my mouth water. Hopefully Ill find you one day needing help and ill be there with a pat on that ass.  - knightinshiningarmer Dear dark haired boy who always looks pissed/sleepy   i dont know whether you're gay or straight, but i want to fuck your fine ass. literally your ass is like a piece of art and whenever i see you in the fashion department or on the street with your black platforms i want to stick it up there. damn dat ass.  -a casual admirer You wear grey skinny jeans and desert boots...  I feel like I can see the Northern Lights in your hazel eyes. When you finish your guitar, I'll sing you a song.  I saw a flock of loons today and thought of you. (That's not true at all-- the loon part. But, I still thought of you.) Dear Asian girl with the yellow sweater who had the yellow bike today. I think you're really sexy and I wished you lived in Chicago instead of Detroit. Dear Pale Beauty with the Septum Piercing,   Every time I see your forrest green shoes coming down the Columbus hallway my heart flutters. Your green eyes have a cat-like depth. (Just for the record, I like cats a lot, not in a weird way though.) You are lovely... I like your prints. I want to hold your fingerless-glove-clad hands to keep them warm. Let's go to Burning Man together.   - Howlin' For You... Dear girl who works at Pret with an acorn tattoo behind her ear,  I'm totally straight, and have a boyfriend, but I can honestly say I have a serious infatuation with you. I'd love to just sit and stare at your face for a few hours, maybe even touch it. Who knows.  Love, Ridiculously tall girl who always orders a chai tea with extra cinnamon. Dear petite Milano girl, To be specific this goes out to the petite Milano girl that makes shoes. I've seen you around, not in the fashion department cause I'm not gay or Asian, but I've had a class with you and we talked about how much we don't trust cats. We locked stares and you didn't seem to be able to look away, which made me think I had something on my face or in my facial hair, but now I know it's because you love my eyes. You seem like fun and carry yourself in a way that's very sexy, not slutty sexy.. I would love to take u out in a date or just chill drinking bum wine and watching Svengoolie. So maybe next time I see you ill gather the nerve to ask you.  Sincerly, Bearded printmaker Birthday Boy, You're my best friend. You're my muse. You're my favourite person. I would waste my time with you watching lame movies, smoke cigarettes, drink wine, and make art until we are both crusty old farts. Just saying. Luke Dear Chinese grad student who chews with his mouth open and obliviously gets sauce all over his lips in a really gross way, I think you are cute anyway. Dear Sonny, did i do something wrong? We had so much history, what happened? You knew everything I wanted without even asking.  I miss you.   Please, we can get through this; let's make up...and some goddamn avocado sandwiches. To the lady-lovin-ladies of SAIC... how am I supposed to tell you from the rest of the girls who dress like lesbians? Where I come from, plaid and Docs were a pretty good indication, not anymore. We should work out some sort of symbolic system or something. -gaydar-less lezzo %br/ Output (press Generate Admiration button)
